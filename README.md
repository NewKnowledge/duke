# duke -- Dataset Understanding via Knowledge-graph Embeddings

First, you should download wiki2vec model (English Wikipedia) using a torrent as described on this link:

https://github.com/idio/wiki2vec

Untar it at a preferred location and note it. Open main.py and modify embedding_path variable to the aforementioned location.

Using python3.5+, pip3 install required libraries in requirements.txt. 

Identify a dataset of interest, and specify its path in main.py.

Finally, run it as follows, and enjoy the magic...

```bash
python3 main.py
```
